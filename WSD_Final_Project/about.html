            <h2>The Main Purpose of This Website</h2>
                <p id="intro">
                    The Geopolitics Online is a service mainly focusing on providing a <strong>blog</strong> discussing geopolitical 
                    issues and a regularly updated database of useful <strong>sources</strong> for curious learners of geopolitical matters.
                    The Geopolitics Online's website, the blog, and the sources page are especially meant for the students of international 
                    relations, political science, and geopolitics, but also for anyone interested in developing their knowledge in the field 
                    of geopolitics.<br />

            <h3>The Current Situation</h3>
                <p id="situation">
                    The Geopolitics Online website was made during the website development course. 
                    <strong>Thank you for the course teachers to help me learning the basics of the website development. 
                        I am excited to continue this process.</strong>
                    There is indeed a chance of continuing its development later, during other courses, or on free time.
                    As the website is made for learning purposes (developing websites), it is still not a ready website for its final purpose (defined above).
                    Please keep this in mind, and again: 
                    <span style="color:rgb(229, 15, 204)">Welcome to come back to this website to see future updates, development, and to learn more.</span> 
                </p>
